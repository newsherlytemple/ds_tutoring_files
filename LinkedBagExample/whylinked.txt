before, we made bag using an array

some problem with arrays:
    ALWAYS fixed size
    even if we dont see this
    we either:
        (1) set the size (saves that specfic amount of memory)
        (2) dont set the size (compiler saves a LOT of memory)
    so two possible problems:
        (1) we might run out of room in our array 
            (if memory chunk is small)
        (2) we might have too much wasted space in our memory 
            (if memory chunk is large)
    we want the most optimal amount of memory to be used
    ideally, the exact amount of memory that we need for 
        the size of our bag

how can we do this?
LINKED NODES!

okay, what is a node?
